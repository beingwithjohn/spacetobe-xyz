-- The Practice Log.
--
-- Two shapes of run share one set of tables:
--
--   evergreen  joinable any day, year round, no end. Each person's day one is
--              the day they joined, so "day 18" means eighteen days for them.
--   fixed      a cohort with a start date and a length. Everyone is on the same
--              day number. Beyond Belief is one of these: 2026-09-16, 35 days.
--
-- Everything below is written so the only difference between them is the
-- anchor a day index counts from, and whether there is a last day.
--
-- A mark is a person, a local calendar date and a timestamp. Nothing else is
-- stored about a practice — not a duration, not a quality, not a kind.

  -- does need to know how many places there are, and what people are joining.
